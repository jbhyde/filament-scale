# filament-scale
Project to weigh and display the amount of filament left on a 3D printer filament spool.

The Problem:

There have been several occasions where I have been running low on 3D printer filament but went ahead with a print anyway only to come back to a half finished print and an empty spool.

The Idea:

Create a spool holder that will weigh the amount of filament currently on the machine then I can determine whether there will be enough filament to complete the print (I will know the amount of filament needed for the print when I slice it in CURA).

Considerations:

Menu system to change between functional mode and calibration mode
Ability to tare/calibrate the system
